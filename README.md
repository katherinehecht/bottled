Note:
•	Hi! I changed a few things to my project so I submitted this document and my files twice. I apologize for the inconvenience. I named the correct files project2.php and Hecht,Katherine-finalproject2-18207189.zip. Thank you!
Purpose: 
•	I chose option 1 and built a business website with the purpose of marketing a gift product. The companies sells reusable water bottles that are customizable by size, color, and an optional monogram. These water bottles are then filled with sweets, cash, and / or a thoughtful note. 
Pages:
1.	Index.php
a.	This page acts as a home page. Here, there is a slide show, using javascript, that shows the user how the company works
2.	Bottles.php
a.	This page shows images of the different customizations a user can add to their reusable bottle.
3.	Fillings.php
a.	This page shows the different fillings one can add to their reusable bottle. 
4.	Order.php
a.	This page uses html forms to collect the order from the user regarding their bottle and its fillings.
b.	Once the user clicks submit and all of the required information is filled in, they are then redirected to action.php.
i.	This page thanks the user for shopping and displays their order using php.
5.	About.php
a.	This page uses css to nicely display information about the company and myself.
Other files:
•	Header.php & footer.php
